## Build and Setup

### Install Lua

**Note:** This assumes a Linux system.

If you don't care about version, you can simply open a terminal and type `lua`.
Then from there you can install via `sudo apt-get install ...`

Otherwise you can install from the official
[website](https://www.lua.org/download.html).

#### Quick Install

```
curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.4.tar.gz
tar zxf lua-5.3.4.tar.gz
cd lua-5.3.4
make linux test
# (Optional) move executable to /usr/local/bin
# cd src; mv lua /usr/local/bin
```
